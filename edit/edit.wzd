(The instructions are below the license here: read both.)
BY DOWNLOADING YOU SIGNIFY YOU HAVE READ AND AGREED TO ALL OF THE CONDITIONS LISTED HERE.  This is a C/assembly program.  It is possible for a C/assembly program to damage data and even to make your organizer inoperable.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  NO GUARANTEES ARE MADE. By downloading this program to your organizer you agree not to hold the author(s) responsible for any damage to data, hardware or anything else.
IF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU ARE NOT LEGALLY PERMITTED TO DOWNLOAD OR USE THE PROGRAM. This program may be freely distributed but only provided that this description is unmodified.  This program is copyright (c) 2001-2002 Alexander R Pruss.

It is strongly recommended you back up your Wizard before running C/assembler programs.

NOTE: If a C/assembly program hangs due to a bug, you may need to flip the battery switch on the bottom of the Wizard back and forth.  If the Wizard does not respond to this, taking the batteries out for half a minute should help.  If this doesn't help, you've read the WARNING above.  None of this should be necessary, but no guarantees are made.
This program may not have been sufficiently tested.  Report bugs and suggestions to: ap85@georgetown.edu.
NOTE: Any alarms going off while program is running will be missed.
This is a memo editor for 16K-long memos.  Usage is pretty self-explanatory, though please read at least the next section.
An optional donation is requested but not required for use of this program.  Press MENU in MemoEdit for more information.
You can assign MemoEdit to be your default memo editor activated when you press the MEMO key.  Go to MY PROGRAMS, highlight MemoEdit, press MENU, select option 1: "Assign to key" (press 1), select the third key (press 3).

Official differences from built-in memo editor:
1. MemoEdit memos can be up to 16K long.  The extra data is stored in special Dec. 31, 2099 memos with title starting with zzzzy! (the y has an ' accent mark).  Editing these memos or syncing them will change their date, and the long memos will cease to work.  Having ordinary memos whose title or text body starts with zzzzy! (y with a ' accent) will cause trouble, and editing the special memos can make MemoEdit stop working.  To fix the dates on the special memos, run MemoFix (don't run MemoFix otherwise).
2. If you ever need to reconstruct a long memo by hand, here's how to do it.  Look first for what seems an ordinary memo with a normal date and the right title that says in its body that it is a special MemoEdit generated memo, and whose body starts with zzzzy! (y with a ' accent).
Now, the first line of this memo is a special signature of this memo, e.g.: zzzzy!wBDODPAC0AAC0C.  The last character indicates how many memos (including this one) the given MemoEdit memo is split into: A=1, B=2, C=3.  In this case, 3.
You can reconstruct the memo by looking for all memos whose title is this signature line, except for the last character of the signature line which changes. These contain the data of the memo, sequentially ordered by the last character of their title.
In the example, there are two such parts, with titles zzzzy!wBDODPAC0AAC0A and zzzzy!wBDODPAC0AAC0B, in this order.
3. You can get into trouble (e.g., these memos not showing up, or errors in reading others) if you have any memos whose titles start with zzzz (or ZZZZ or ZzZZ and so on) and whose fifth title character is z or y (either case and with any or no accents).  Rename any such memos before running MemoEdit to prevent trouble.  (If you create such a memo in MemoEdit, MemoEdit will rename it before saving, but the Wizard's built-in memo editor won't let you do it.)
4. Get into edit mode by pressing ENTER on a selected memo.  As in the Wizard, save changes by pressing ENTER in editor, press ESC to abandon changes, and press 2ND+ENTER to save a copy of the memo.
5. Search and search-again, in either browse or edit mode, by pressing 2nd+s or 2nd+g, respectively.
6. In edit mode, the NEW key functions like a PC's CTRL key in many ways, and some special keys follow the standard of WordStar-compatible PC text editors.  Thus, NEW-T deletes a word to the right, NEW-Y deletes a line, NEW-G deletes a character to the right.
NEW-leftarrow and NEW-rightarrow move by a word.  NEW-backspace deletes the word to the left.  I bet some of you have been missing these features in the built-in memo editor.
7. Special ASCII characters like {} or [] are available via the key combinations used in WizTerm.  They're accessible via the CATEGORY key. Specifically, pressing one of opqrw190,. together with the CATEGORY key yields []~\`|{}<> respectively.  Thus, CATEGORY-9 is {.
(CATEGORY is the key to the left of the space bar.)
8. CATEGORY in browse mode toggles sort order between TITLE and DATE.
9. Cannot copy memo to clipboard from browse mode (the mode where you see the list of memo titles), but only from within edit mode.
10. MemoEdit is MUCH faster for almost all operations than the Wizard's memo editor.  Paging through memos is much faster, browsing memo titles is much faster, etc.
11. In browse mode, 2nd+up and 2nd+down do what you would expect them to.
12. Font changing works in edit mode.  Just press 2nd-f to cycle through the fonts available.  If you've loaded new fonts from the Font Package (see home.att.net/~apruss) into one or both of the font memory slots, it will work.
13. Secret memo titles show up EVEN IF YOUR WIZARD IS LOCKED.  However, if the Wizard is locked, you won't be able to view them.  MemoEdit doesn't let you create secret memos, though if you edit a secret memo, it will stay secret.  Anyway, the Wizard's "secret memos" have extremely low security and can be recovered from backups, or by a somewhat clever hacker.  If security matters and you live in the U.S. or Canada, you may consider buying SecureEdit, Alexander R. Pruss's 128-bit encrypted text editor for $15: write ap85@georgetown.edu for more information (a demo with encryption disabled is available).  SecureEdit doesn't store data in memos but in a different way, but still allows for 16K of secure data per file.  SecureEdit will also let you store secret data without a global password for the Wizard, and with a separate password for each data file.
14. In browse mode, ESC interrupts a search.
15. In the editor, you can press 2nd+u to upload data from the current memo to the PC via the serial port: the whole memo is uploaded unless you have an area selected in which case the selected area is uploaded.  You can press 2nd+d to download serial data from the PC.  The parameters for both transfers are: 9600 baud, no parity, eight bits, handshaking either off (for upload to PC) or else either off or software (for download from PC).  To transfer data to or from a PC, you can use the HyperTerminal program, which is included with Windows (though you may need to install it from your Windows CD).  You should be able to access it via something like START | ACCESSORIES | COMMUNICATIONS | HYPERTERMINAL (or maybe INTERNET instead of COMMUNICATIONS), which should let you run HYPERTRM. You'll be asked to enter a name for the connection.  Put in something like "Organizer".  Under "Connect using", select Direct to comx, where comx is the com port you use for uploading things to your organizer.  Under "Bits per second", choose 9600.  Under "Data bits", put 8.  Under "Parity", select "None".  Under "Stop bits", choose 1.  And under "Flow control", select "None".  Then, go to FILE | PROPERTIES | SETTINGS | ASCII SETUP and make sure that "Send line ends with line feeds" is checked.  To see what data is sent to the Wizard while it's being sent, you may also want to make sure "Echo typed characters locally" is checked.
To send a text file from the PC to the Wizard, press 2nd+d on the Wizard when editing a memo.  Then, in Hyperterminal do TRANSFER | SEND TEXT FILE and select the file to send.  The file will then be sent, and a progress bar will show up on the Organizer screen.  When the bar stops growing, you're done, and you can press any key on the Organizer. To send a text file from the Wizard to the PC, choose TRANSFER | CAPTURE TEXT, and select a filename.  Then, when editing the memo in MemoEdit, press 2nd+u (with region highlighted if desired) to send to the PC. Then, choose TRANSFER | CAPTURE TEXT | STOP on the PC, and you'll be done.  When you exit Hyperterminal, save your new connection so you won't have to enter in parameters each time.
16. There is an emergency data recovery function.  It is currently triggered when you hit the power button in the editor.  It will save the file (though for technical reasons, only the first 16378 characters are saved, which means, given the 16384 character limit, you can lose up to six characters) to memory, and recover it the next time you run MemoEdit. However, the memory area used for the emergency save is the "libox auxiliary memory area" which is used by a number of other C/assembly programs like Loader.  Thus, if you run some other C/assembly program before running MemoEdit (or remove the batteries), you may lose the data. (If you have an AutoRun program that may do that, you will want to turn on your organizer using the MY PROGRAMS key to skip the AutoRun program.) The emergency data recovery function will also overwrite the clipboard.
17. In the editor, press NEW-MINUS to toggle key-click, and in browse mode, press the MINUS key to toggle key-click.  Note: MemoEdit is fully KeyTune 3 compatible, and the key-click setting will be restored next time MemoEdit is run.  You will need the latest version of KeyTune--get it from home.att.net/~apruss
18. In the editor, press NEW-s to get a time and date stamp.
 Official limitations (not bugs, and no plan to fix in near future) include:
1. Absolute 1957 byte limit on clipboard data.  (I may extend it to 4357 bytes if I feel like putting in the effort later and if people ask for it.)
2. If you copy data to clipboard from a long memo, and then save the memo, to have the clipboard available to another memo, the file length plus clipboard length cannot exceed 16384 bytes.  (This included memo title.)
3. No support for most characters not in ASCII 32-127 plus newline range.  The present version supports the following special characters: acute(')-accented e, o, u and a;  grave(`)-accented e, o, u and a; circumflex(^)-accented e, o, u, a, E and O;  umlaut-accented e, o, u, a, E, O, U, A;  tilde(~)-marked n and N;  cedilla-marked c;  German ss; Euro;  pound;  degree-symbol;  bullet;  Greek mu.  All but the pound, degree-symbol, bullet and mu are accessed in the same way that these are accessed on the Wizard keyboard and marked (at least they're marked on non-U.S. models).  Acute-e is 2nd-k e, grave-o is 2nd-j o, circumflex-E is 2nd-n shift-e, umlaut-A is 2nd-b shift-A, tilde-N is 2nd-l shift-N, cedilla-c is 2nd-m, ss is 2nd-comma, euro is 2nd-period.  The additional characters are accessed as follows: pound is 2nd-3, degree is 2nd-0 (zero), bullet is 2nd-minus, and mu is 2nd-y.  All other special characters if present in a memo will be changed to a * character. In the fixed-width font version, these special characters will look like trash. These special characters do not transfer over the serial line.
4. The clipboard data will be preserved even if you exit MemoEdit, provided you don't reset the Wizard (turning off with power button is OK), and providing you don't run another program that uses the area of auxiliary memory where the clipboard data is stored (e.g., Loader is quite likely to destroy the clipboard data).
(MemoEdit should know its clipboard has been overwritten through a number of sanity checks.)
5. Search (2nd+s in browse mode) only searches memos, not other data types.
6. Keep your clock set correctly.  Two memos saved at the same clock time could interfere with one another.  If your clock is set correctly, this won't happen.
7. In edit mode, the title of the memo is the first 20 characters of the first line in the display (it's shown underlined).
8. The go to title by typing title of memo feature only works for titles of memos that do not require shift keys to access special symbols. Alphanumeric titles work just fine.
9. If you press ENTER immediately after doing a search in the title browser and you had successfully found an entry, then the editor will show you the entry.
10. This is not meant to be an exact clone of the Wizard's memo editor.

Unofficial limitations and known bugs (may be removed in later revisions):
1. The pageup and pagedown keys don't work as neatly as I would wish, though they don't seem to be buggy.
